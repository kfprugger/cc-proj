==================================================

Agent: Good morning, thank you for calling PatientLink Support. My name is Douglas. How can I assist you today?

Dr. Chambers: Hello Douglas, this is Dr. Chambers calling from Contoso Emergency Care. I’m following up regarding a recent patient encounter, and I need to clarify some details about a medication listed in the records.

Agent: Absolutely, Dr. Chambers. I’ll be happy to help with that. May I have the patient’s full name and date of birth to begin?

Dr. Chambers: Certainly. The patient’s name is Nathan Lloyd, and his date of birth is March 24th, 1969.

Agent: Thank you, Dr. Chambers. For verification purposes, do you have the patient’s ID number as well?

Dr. Chambers: Yes, I do. The patient ID is CTM629221.

Agent: Perfect, thank you for providing that information. Just to confirm, you’re calling from Contoso Emergency Care and your name is Dr. Chambers, correct?

Dr. Chambers: That’s correct.

Agent: Thank you, Dr. Chambers. I’m now pulling up Nathan Lloyd’s record. One moment, please… [brief pause] All right, I have Mr. Lloyd’s information on my screen. Can you please confirm the date of his last visit so I can ensure we’re discussing the correct encounter?

Dr. Chambers: Yes, the visit I’m referring to was on June 5th, 2025.

Agent: Excellent, I have the June 5th encounter here. I see the diagnosis was anxiety. Could you please specify what information you need regarding his medication?

Dr. Chambers: Of course. There’s a record of Metformin being listed in his medication history. I just wanted to confirm if that was prescribed during this visit for anxiety, or if it’s part of his ongoing medication list. The use of Metformin for anxiety isn’t standard, so I wanted to clarify.

Agent: That’s a great question, Dr. Chambers. Let me look into the medication section of Mr. Lloyd’s chart for that visit. [pause] According to the visit documentation, Metformin is listed under his ongoing home medications. There’s no new prescription for Metformin associated with the June 5th visit. The encounter notes indicate it was documented as part of his active medications, but not prescribed for anxiety.

Dr. Chambers: That makes sense. Do you have any details on who originally prescribed the Metformin, or the indication for its use?

Agent: Let me check the medication history for that information. [brief pause] It appears Metformin was first documented in his record in March 2024, prescribed by Dr. Patel at Green Valley Primary Care. The indication listed is Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.

Dr. Chambers: Excellent, thank you for confirming that. That aligns with his primary care history. I just wanted to make sure there wasn’t any new indication for Metformin, especially related to the anxiety diagnosis.

Agent: Absolutely, and I can confirm there isn’t any note here indicating Metformin was prescribed or recommended for anxiety. The medication reconciliation documentation from the June 5th visit specifically lists it as a chronic medication for diabetes management.

Dr. Chambers: That’s very helpful, Douglas. While I have you, could you please verify if any new medications were started during the June 5th visit? I want to ensure our discharge instructions are accurate.

Agent: Certainly, Dr. Chambers. Let me check the discharge summary… [pause] According to the summary, there was a short-term prescription for Hydroxyzine 25mg, to be taken as needed for anxiety symptoms, up to three times daily. No other new medications were initiated during that encounter.

Dr. Chambers: Perfect, that matches what we have on our end. Thank you for confirming. Also, was there any documented follow-up plan included in the discharge instructions?

Agent: Yes, the discharge plan recommends follow-up with Mr. Lloyd’s primary care provider within two weeks, and a referral to behavioral health services for ongoing anxiety management. There’s also a note suggesting patient education was provided regarding medication adherence and lifestyle modifications for both his anxiety and diabetes.

Dr. Chambers: That’s very thorough. I appreciate the detailed information, Douglas. All of this will help us coordinate his care more effectively.

Agent: I’m glad I could assist, Dr. Chambers. Is there anything else you’d like me to review or clarify regarding Mr. Lloyd’s record?

Dr. Chambers: No, that covers all my questions for today. Thank you again for your help—this was a very smooth process.

Agent: You’re very welcome, Dr. Chambers. If you need any further information or support in the future, please don’t hesitate to reach out. We’re here to help.

Dr. Chambers: Thank you, Douglas. Have a wonderful day.

Agent: You too, Dr. Chambers. Take care, and thank you for calling PatientLink Support.
