==================================================

Agent: Thank you for calling Contoso Specialty Center. This is Debra. How may I help you today?

Cristina Simmons: Hi, my name is Cristina Simmons. I’m calling about my sister, Elizabeth Jenkins. She’s a patient with you and I have some questions about her care.

Agent: Thank you, Ms. Simmons. For privacy, I’ll need to verify some details. May I have Elizabeth’s date of birth?

Cristina Simmons: Yes, it’s March 29, 1980.

Agent: Thank you. And may I confirm if you’re authorized to discuss Elizabeth’s medical information? Do you have her consent or medical power of attorney?

Cristina Simmons: Yes, I’m listed as her emergency contact and she’s authorized me to speak on her behalf.

Agent: Thank you for confirming. How can I assist you regarding Elizabeth’s care today?

Cristina Simmons: She’s been having some new back pain. Is it okay for her to continue taking Lisinopril, or should we contact her doctor?

Agent: Lisinopril is for blood pressure and shouldn’t affect her back pain, but if the pain is new or worsening, we recommend she contacts her physician to rule out any complications. I can schedule an appointment if you’d like.

Cristina Simmons: That would be helpful, thank you.

Agent: You’re welcome. I’ll arrange that and follow up with you shortly. Is there anything else I can assist with today?

Cristina Simmons: No, that’s all. Thank you for your help.

Agent: You’re welcome. Have a good day.
